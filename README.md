# Project-2---NDOT-Mix-Design
The purpose of this project is to automate the concrete mix design process currently maintained in an Excel-based workflow by NDOT. The objective is to translate the logic contained in the “Mix Design” worksheet of the NDOT Concrete Mix Excel file into a structured, modular, and fully functional Python program. The final system will allow users to enter material properties and design parameters through sequential prompts and generate a professionally formatted weight chart for one cubic yard of concrete. This automation will improve repeatability, transparency, and reliability while supporting future integration into a web-based platform.
